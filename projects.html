			<h3>Joe Dickinson Portfolio</h3>
			<div class="project-photo" id="joe-port">
			</div>
			<p>
				I was approached by a tattoo artist to design and build a website to showcase their work. My first aim of this project was to ensure that the artist's work spoke for itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				The key elements here were to let visitors see the tattoos and artwork as easily and possible and, secondly, make it easy to contact the tattoo artist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It was built using HTML5, CSS, Sass and JavaScript.

			<h3>Run Dem Crew</h3>
			<div class="project-photo" id="rundem-port">
			</div>
			<p>
				My aim for this project was to redesign an already existing website.
				In this case it was for the <a href="http://www.rundemcrew.com/" target="_blank">Run Dem Crew</a>, a running club based in London. 
				I felt that the original design was extremely cluttered so my initial idea was strip it down and give it a minimal design.
			</p>
			<p>
				The club has a lot of great imagery that they use in their social media outlets which really helped this rebuild.
			</p>
			<p>
				It features an image carousel, a page transition effect and a fixed navigation all built with JavaScript. It is also fully responsive.
			</p>
			<p>
				The biggest challenge I faced with this project was creating the image carousel for the Gallery page. It was the first time I had used a jQuery plugin so getting used to implementing one was the biggest hurdle for me.
				After coming across a tutorial video on YouTube I was soon comfortable getting the plugin working exactly the way I wanted.

			<h3>JavaScript Image Gallery</h3>
			<p>
				This image gallery was created with JavaScript and CSS. It works by adding and removing a "show" class to an image which is triggered by a click event.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fade effect is created by a CSS transition attribute.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was built using HTML5, CSS, Sass and JavaScript.

			<h3>Family Christmas</h3>
			<!-- <img src="images/christmas.png" class="project-photo"> -->
			<p>
				For Christmas 2015 I decided to build a special and unique present for my family to enjoy. My thought process behind this project was to make it similar to an advent calendar. When ever the user hovers or focuses, as in on a touch screen device, a family photography is revealed.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was built using HTML5, CSS, Sass and the transition effect is created through JavaScript. CSS is used to reveal the photos. From the initial design to final build this project took me just over a day to complete. I would of liked to of added more features to the page had I had more time.
